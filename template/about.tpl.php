<h2>About the project</h2>

<p>The project offers open access in a friendly, interactive and visual way to public information regarding the spatial distribution of Romanian datasets referring to political preferences based on uninominal districts and 2011 national census data.</p>
<p>Further more, it allows the user to query the maps and to create it's own thematic maps based on filters applied to attributes and/or geographical regions.</p>
<p>There are four main predefined categories, Local Elections, Chamber of Deputies, Senate and Statistics that allow a clear view upon the political preferences, demographic and sociological dimension of the Romanian territory, from its' smallest administrative division.</p>
<p>The project Political Colours of Romania interactively mapped has been voluntarily developed by a team of nine members, with different professional backgrounds: Petru Zoltan, Zolt&aacute;n Sipos, Bogdan Grama, Iulian Iuga, Vasile Craciunescu, Andrei Cipu, Cristi Draghici, Mihai Dumitru, Codrina Maria Ilie.</p>
